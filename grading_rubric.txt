* Introduction: 20% of grade

Division of work listed:                           ____ / 5

One base case clearly described:                   ____ / 5

One edge case clearly described:                   ____ / 5

One corner case clearly described:                 ____ / 5

* Test Plan: 30% of grade

Preconditions include all state
needed for reproducibility:                        ____ / 5

Execution steps are numbered and
clearly delineated:                                ____ / 5

Postconditions result in no
false positive defects:                            ____ / 5

Postconditions describe expected behavior
given the context and not merely requirements:     ____ / 5

Test case postconditions check given requirements: ____ / 10

* Defects Found and Described: 30% of grade

Must be >= 3 defects! 10% off for each missing one.

Defects are Reproducible:                          ____ / 10

behavior verbatim to help debugging:               ____ / 10

Defects properly routed through GitHub issues:     ____ / 10
